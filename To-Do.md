Things left to do:
- Smart contract
    - All attributes and functions have correct access classifiers (private/internal/public)
    - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range (0.8.4)
    - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
    - Confirm: only 2 types of items, local and not-local
    - Verify contractAddress passed in is correct
    - How to determine contractAddress is local/varified/unvarified ?
    - Create `transferLocalMarketSale` when price is 0, transfer in one transaction?
    - Ensure openzeppelin access control is used
        - Main admin which can control all roles in contracts
        - Each collection owner is an admin who can add/remove roles
    - Monetary
        - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
        - Dividends
    - Cancel sales
        - Only able to cancel direct and immediate sale types
        - Auctions can not be cancelled!
    - Make all error messages unique
    - Address all `@todo` in the code
    - Convert all `owner` to `Access` contracts
    - Is it possible to not transfer NFT to contract upon `createMarketSale`. Rather just get approval,
        then transfer NFT to buyer and money to seller upon `completeMarketSale`?

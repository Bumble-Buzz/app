- Smart contract
    - All functions have correct access classifiers
    - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range
    - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
    - Ensure all appropriate attributes and functions are private/internal
    - Monetary
        - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
        - Dividends
- Front-end dapp
- Social media
    - Discord server

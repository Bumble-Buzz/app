Things left to do:
- Smart contract
    - Name the app, then make the change everywhere
    - All attributes and functions have correct access classifiers (private/internal/public)
    - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range (0.8.4)
    - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
    - Ensure openzeppelin access control is used
        - Main admin which can control all roles in contracts
        - Each collection owner is an admin who can add/remove roles
    - Monetary
        - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
        - Dividends
    - Make all error messages unique
    - Change contract name from `Sale` to `Transaction`
    - NFT contract `approve` one instead of `approve all`, give option to do both
    - Rename `Bank > CollectionAccount > reflectionVault` to `tokenVault`?
    - Transaction types
        - Transfer
            - Transfer of asset, no sale, commissions or incentives.
            - Use ERC721 functions to do a simple transfer from one account to another
        - Direct
            - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
        - Immediate
        - Auction
            - During the auction, buyer is not able to back out of (or cancel) the auction
            - What to do if no buyer is foind in an auction? Only then seller is able to `reclaim` their NFT.
    - Commissions
        - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
        - Artist commission cap at 20%?
    - Incentives
        - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
        - Have different configurable variables for marketplace incentives (direct / immediate / auction)
        - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
    - Address all `@todo` in the code
- Front-end dapp
    - Easy way to set ENV variables in docker image / k8s, for contract addresses, admin accounts, etc...
- Social media
    - Discord server
    - Twitter account

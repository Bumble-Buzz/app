Things left to do:
- Misc
  - Create env / chain specific database / table names
  - Chain secific stuff keeping in mind dAAP will be also on other chains
- Smart contract
  - what happens if completeMarketSale is called when sale does not exist?
  - Name the app, then make the change everywhere
  - Collection
    - Add maximum on total supply?
  - All attributes and functions have correct access classifiers (private/internal/public)
  - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range (0.8.4)
  - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
  - Ensure openzeppelin access control is used
    - Main admin which can control all roles in contracts
    - Each collection owner is an admin who can add/remove roles
  - Monetary
    - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
    - Dividends
  - Make all error messages unique
  - Change contract name from `Sale` to `Transaction`
  - NFT contract `approve` one instead of `approve all`, give option to do both
  - Rename `Bank > CollectionAccount > reflectionVault` to `tokenVault`?
  - Transaction types
    - Transfer
      - Transfer of asset, no sale, commissions or incentives.
      - Use ERC721 functions to do a simple transfer from one account to another
    - Direct
      - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
    - Immediate
    - Auction
      - During the auction, buyer is not able to back out of (or cancel) the auction
      - What to do if no buyer is foind in an auction? Only then seller is able to `reclaim` their NFT.
  - Commissions
    - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
    - Artist commission cap at 20%?
  - Incentives
    - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
    - Have different configurable variables for marketplace incentives (direct / immediate / auction)
    - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
  - Address all `@todo` in the code
- Back-end
  - Put a max limit number on all APIs that use the limit parameter
  - Convert all getter API calls from `query` to `get`
  - Database
    - Tables (per network/chain)
      - users: User information
        - walletId, name, bio, picture, [notifications], timestamp
        - PK: walletId
        - LSI: timestamp ?
        - GSI: 
      - contracts: All known contracts (need to be updated constantly)
        - contractAddress, name, symbol, isVerified::number, type::721
        - PK: contractAddress
        - LSI: 
        - GSI: isVerified, type
      - collection: List of collections
        - id, name, contractAddress, description, totalSupply, reflection, commission, incentive, owner, collectionType, ownerIncentiveAccess, active::number, category, image
        - PK: id
        - LSI: 
        - GSI: active, category + active, owner + active (only get data that you need) -> maybe for `name` and `contractAddress` for search results?
      - asset: List of assets
        - contractAddress, tokenId, collectionId, commission, creator (0x===verified/unverified collections), owner, config, onSale (0===no sale, 1===yes sale), saleId (0===no sale), buyer (0x===no buyer), price (0===no sale), saleType::number (3===no sale), priceHistory::array, activity::array, offers::array, category ('null'===verified collections), active::number
        - PK: contractAddress, tokenId
        - LSI: creator, owner
        - GSI: collectionId, onSale + owner
      - sale: List of assets on sale in marketplace
        - contractAddress, tokenId, saleId, collectionId, seller, buyer, price, sold, saleType::number, category, active::number
        - PK: contractAddress, tokenId
        - LSI: seller, buyer
        - GSI: seller + active, category + active (only get data that you need)
- Front-end dapp
  - Asset
    - Monetary
      - Artist Commission: Only show for Local assets. Do NOT show for other collections
      - Collection Commission/Reflection/Incentive: Only show for verified collections (assets that are verified)
  - Profile
    - General
      - Only show blockchain / monetary information if user is valid AND logged in
  - change API pull BATCH_SIZE to 50 from 20.
    - It needs to be big enough to accomodate for large screen size, so user can scroll down to pull more data
  - what happens is asset is already on sale when creating asset record in database?
  - Ensure no entered number is greater than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Or find a solution to deal with this.
  - Ensure images can be loaded via both IPFS and direct url
  - Ability to delete collection from db and blockchain
  - Easy way to set ENV variables in docker image / k8s, for contract addresses, admin accounts, etc...
  - Initialize CORS properly as explained in the docs
  - API
    - Make sure secure APIs are only accessable who is allowed to
    - Ensure to check blockchain in API calls when necessary
  - AWS
    - IAM
      - Dynamodb: Give only appropriate access as needed
      - Only access to add/remove items in tables
      - No access to create/delete tables
  - Security
    - Pages: admin / mod auth check
    - APIs: admin / mod auth check
- Social media
  - Discord server
  - Twitter account

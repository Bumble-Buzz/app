Things left to do:
- Smart contract
    - Name the app, then make the change everywhere
    - All attributes and functions have correct access classifiers (private/internal/public)
    - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range (0.8.4)
    - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
    - Confirm: only 2 types of items, local and not-local
    - Verify contractAddress passed in is correct
    - How to determine contractAddress is local/varified/unvarified ?
    - Create `transferLocalMarketSale` when price is 0, transfer in one transaction?
    - Ensure openzeppelin access control is used
        - Main admin which can control all roles in contracts
        - Each collection owner is an admin who can add/remove roles
    - Monetary
        - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
        - Dividends
    - Cancel sales
        - Only able to cancel direct and immediate sale types
        - Auctions can not be cancelled!
    - Make all error messages unique
    - Address all `@todo` in the code
    - Convert all `owner` to `Access` contracts
    - Is it possible to not transfer NFT to contract upon `createMarketSale`. Rather just get approval,
        then transfer NFT to buyer and money to seller upon `completeMarketSale`?
    - Change contract name from `Sale` to `Transaction`
    - For direct sales, take out cut for maretplace / artist? Give incentives?
    - NFT contract `approve` one instead of `approve all`, give option to do both
    - Rename `Bank > CollectionAccount > reflectionVault` to `tokenVault`?
    - Transaction types
        - Transfer
            - Transfer of asset, no sale, commissions or incentives.
        - Direct
            - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
        - Immediate
        - Auction
            - Duringthe auction, buyer is not able to back out of the auction
            - What to do if no buyer is foind in an auction? Only then seller is able to `reclaim` their NFT.
    - Commissions
        - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
        - Artist commission cap at 20%?
    - Incentives
        - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
        - Have different configurable variables for marketplace incentives (direct / immediate / auction)
        - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
- Front-end dapp

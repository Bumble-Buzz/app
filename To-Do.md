Things left to do:
- Smart contract
  - what happens if completeMarketSale is called when sale does not exist?
  - Name the app, then make the change everywhere
  - Collection
    - Add maximum on total supply?
  - All attributes and functions have correct access classifiers (private/internal/public)
  - Use one specific version in the contracts, not a range (0.8.4)
  - Remove `import "hardhat/console.sol";` from all contracts
  - Ensure openzeppelin access control is used
    - Main admin which can control all roles in contracts
    - Each collection owner is an admin who can add/remove roles
  - Monetary
    - Add option for anyone to donate funds to the contract
    - Dividends
  - Make all error messages unique
  - Change contract name from `Sale` to `Transaction`
  - NFT contract `approve` one instead of `approve all`, give option to do both
  - Rename `Bank > CollectionAccount > reflectionVault` to `tokenVault`?
  - Transaction types
    - Transfer
      - Transfer of asset, no sale, commissions or incentives.
      - Use ERC721 functions to do a simple transfer from one account to another
    - Direct
      - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
    - Immediate
    - Auction
      - During the auction, buyer is not able to back out of (or cancel) the auction
      - What to do if no buyer is foind in an auction? Only then seller is able to `reclaim` their NFT.
  - Commissions
    - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
    - Artist commission cap at 20%?
  - Incentives
    - Have an upper cap of 99%, or no need?
    - Have different configurable variables for marketplace incentives (direct / immediate / auction)
    - Need to be careful with incentives for direct sales. Risk of users selling to their own wallets and making money.
  - Address all `@todo` in the code
- Back-end
  - Put a max limit number on all APIs that use the limit parameter

  - Ability to delete collection from db and blockchain
  - Easy way to set ENV variables in docker image / k8s, for contract addresses, admin accounts, etc...
